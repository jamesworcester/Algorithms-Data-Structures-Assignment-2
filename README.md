# Algorithms & Data Structures Assignment 2
This assignment revolved around:
- Implementing my chosen data structure (an AVL tree) to represent a lexicon of words, with the lexicon storing word frequency and a list of neighbouring words (words that differ by one character)
- Defining a word class
- building a lexicon from a supplied input file
- focussing on reducing time complexity and execution time
